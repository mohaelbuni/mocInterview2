I feel that both teamwork and independent work situations come with their advantages and disadvantages. One advantage to teamwork is the collaboration with diverse professionals, however, working in groups every day can take away from focus and productivity in some cases. Similarly, even though independent work can provide the space for quiet concentration and productivity, it can also take away from some of the creative ideas and strategies that can come from group collaboration.
