I once worked as a librarian and most of my colleagues, as you can imagine, were very bookish and kept to themselves. I worked with a new recruit who was very social and talkative and although I was very quiet, he was always interacting with me and asking questions. He was new to the job, so it was nice to actually teach somebody else about our tasks. It made me realize that I can open up and communicate quite well
