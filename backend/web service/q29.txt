Last year- I found myself in a situation in which action needed to be taken- and I was the only person available to do it. While I am very skilled at following directions and don't find myself in the position of the primary initiator very often- I got into a scenario that involved me alone witnessing the dishonesty and theft of another employee. what was happening was very clear- and there was nobody else who was going to take the initiative. I ended up beginning a case with human resources- exposing the theft situation which had been going on for some time and solving the mystery of the disappearing products. Looking back on it- going to human resources was one of the hardest decisions I have made in my professional life because I don't generally like to get involved with other people's business- but it was the right thing to do.
